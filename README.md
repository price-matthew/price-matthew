## Who I am

My name's Matthew. I'm a political pollster and data analyst. I work for a company called [Deltapoll](https://deltapoll.co.uk/) and write a blog on Substack called [The Polling Station](https://pollingstation.substack.com/).

## What I'm working on

This GitHub is where I share the R code and data I use for The Polling Station. That includes datafiles collated from public sources, visualisations made with ggplot2, MRP models, and other fun stuff. If you notice any errors or bugs in my data/code, please let me know. Pull requests are welcome.
